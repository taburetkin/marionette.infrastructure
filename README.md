Few words about emoji  
They are representing the state of a component: is it exist? documented? tested?  
And the order is as follow: exist emoji, documented emoji, tested emoji.  
for example:  
- Something ✔ - means `Something` exist but not documented and not tested.  
- Something ✔❌✔ - means `Something` exist and tested but not documented.  
- Something ❌ - means `Something` is not yet exist but will in future.  
- Something 💯✔ - equals ✔✔✔ - exist, documented and tested.
